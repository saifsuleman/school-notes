# Introduction to Conformity
## What is Conformity?
**Conformity**: A change in a person's attitude/behaviour due to a perceived or actual social pressure from a group.

## Types of Conformity

**Kelman (1958)** suggested 3 types of conformity:
-   **Internalisation**: The deepest type of conformity where a person conforms both publicly and privately.
-   **Identification**: When a person conforms publicly by identifying with the group - even if not privately.
-   **Compliance**: Most shallow level of conformity where it's not genuine and will stop when social pressure is relieved.

**Asch (1951)** conducted a study that found that people would conform to seek approval from a group - which supports NSI.

## Explanations for Conformity

Deutsch and Gerard (1955) suggested 2 explanations as to why people conform:
-   **Normative Social Influence:** Humans conform because they want to be accepted from the group - this is an emotional process.
-   **Informational Social Influence**: Humans conform because they want to know the correct information - this is a cognitive process.

**Lucas et al (2006)** conducted a study which provides research support for ISI, he found that increasing task difficulty directly increased conformity.
