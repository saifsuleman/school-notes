# Introduction to Conformity
## What is Conformity?
**Conformity**: A change in a person's attitude/behaviour due to a perceived or actual social pressure from a group.

## Types of Conformity

**Kelman (1958)** suggested 3 types of conformity:
-   **Internalisation**: The deepest type of conformity where a person conforms both publicly and privately.
-   **Identification**: When a person conforms publicly by identifying with the group - even if not privately.
-   **Compliance**: Most shallow level of conformity where it's not genuine and will stop when social pressure is relieved.

**Asch (1951)** conducted a study that found that people would conform to seek approval from a group - which supports NSI.

## Explanations for Conformity

Deutsch and Gerard (1955) suggested 2 explanations as to why people conform:
-   **Normative Social Influence:** Humans conform because they want to be accepted from the group - this is an emotional process.
-   **Informational Social Influence**: Humans conform because they want to know the correct information - this is a cognitive process.

### Research Support for ISI
**Lucas et al (2006)** conducted a study which provides research support for ISI, he found that increasing task difficulty directly increased conformity. He asked students to give answers to mathematical problems, and there was greater conformity to incorrect answers when they were difficult rather when they were easier ones - this was particularly true for students who rated their mathematical ability as poor.

### Individual Differences in ISI
Research shows that NSI does not affect everyone's behaviour in the same way - for example, people who are less concerned with being liked are less affected by NSI than those who care about being liked. These people that have a greater need for association with others are described as **nAffiliators**. These are people who have a greater need for affiliation - a need for being in a relationship with others. **McGhee and Teevan (1967)** found that students in high need of affiliation were more likely to conform.
