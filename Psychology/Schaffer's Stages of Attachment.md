# Schaffer's Stages of Attachment

## Summary

- Formation of early attachment
- Asocial stage
- Indiscriminate Stage
- Specific Attachment
- Multiple Attachments

## Attachment

A close 2 way emotional bond between two individuals where they each see each other as essential for their emotional security

In 1964, Schaffer & Emerson conducted an important study on the formation of early attachment in infants.

## Aim

Schaffer and Emerson aimed to investigate the formation of early attachments. They wanted to find out the age attachments developed, their emotional intensity and to whom infants were attached to.

## Participants

60 babies from Glasgow took part in this study, 31 boys and 29 girls. These babies were from skilled working class families.

## Procedure

The researchers visited the **60 babies** and their mothers at home every month for the **first year**. They visited once again at **18 months**.

The researchers assessed two elements of attachment:

- Separation Anxiety
- Stranger Anxiety

## Findings

Between **6-8 months**, 50% of babies showed signs of **separation anxiety**, usually towards their mother.

Babies were the most attached to the caregiver who was **interactive and sensitive** to the infant signals and facial expressions (reciprocity). It was not entirely about who spent the most time with the baby - but instead about who responded to the infant's signals.

By age **40 weeks**, 80% of the babies had formed a specific attachment, and **30%** had **multiple attachments**.

## Four Stages of Attachment

Schaffer and Emerson identified four stages of attachment in babies.

### Asocial Stage

- Recognises and forms emotional and social bonds with the carer
- Same level of attachments towards human and non-human objects.
- They show preference to familiar adults and they are happier with humans.
  **Age: first few weeks**

### Indiscriminate Stage

- Babies display more **observable** social behaviour.
- They have a specific preference to people rather than objects.
- They accept cuddling from any adult.
- They do not usually shw separation anxiety or stranger anxiety.
  **Age: 2-7 months.**

### Specific Attachment

- The baby will begin to show **separation anxiety** and **stranger anxiety**.
- They have formed a specific attachment (**primary attachment figure**)
- This is the person wh offers the msot interaction and response to the baby signals with the most skills.
  **Age: 7-9 months**

### Multiple Attachments

- Babies form **multiple** attachments.
- These attachments are known as **secondary attachments**.
- Secondary attachments are formed within a month of the specific attachment being formed.

## Conclusion

As babies grow up, they become attached to whoever provides reciprocity - which means whoever responds to the babies' interactions and signals with the most skill - and that attachment develops and progresses in concise stages.
